<h3>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h3>
<p>This Application is supported via advertising and collects data to help the Application serve ads. We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the Application which helps us keep the cost of the Application free. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Application. These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you've downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile web sites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other nonprecise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Application and elsewhere. If you'd like to opt-out from third party use of this type of information to help serve targeted advertising, please visit the section entitled "Opt-out" below.</p>

We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p>
